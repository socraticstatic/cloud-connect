   *     Govern in NaaS and Govern in the AI Fabric — so here they disambiguate
   *     nothing while claiming the horizontal room the description needs. The
   *     desktop bar already dropped them from its in-group links for exactly
   *     this reason (MainNav.tsx, `renderNavLink(item, compact)`).
   *
   *  2. Two per row instead of one. Four verbs become two rows, so the eight
   *     verbs cost four rows rather than eight.
   *
   *  What did NOT change is the description. Both domains carry the identical
   *  four labels, so "Connect" and "Connect" are two different screens with
   *  one name, and below 1280px this drawer is the only place either can be
   *  reached. The description is what tells them apart; deleting it would have
