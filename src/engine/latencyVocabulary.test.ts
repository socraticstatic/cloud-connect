/* ONE latency vocabulary.
 *
 * Cloud Connect used to state three different latencies for the same estate:
 *   - `fabricModel().latencyMs` on /discover, Connect's Performance tile and
 *     both PathChoice cards (geometry: on-ramp site -> region geo),
 *   - the raw seed `r.lat` (and `r.lat * 1.7`) on every /naas/observe flow row,
 *   - a bare `~12ms` literal in the network briefing.
 * us-east-1 read 3ms on Connect and 12ms on the AT&T-controlled flow row one
 * click away — the same private path into the same region, two figures.
 *
 * These tests pin the derivation, not the numbers. Every latency the product
 * displays is `CC.regionLatency(regionId)` or a stated multiple of it, so a
 * seed change moves every surface together and none of them can drift apart.
