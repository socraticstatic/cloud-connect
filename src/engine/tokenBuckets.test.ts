/**
 * Governed and ungoverned tokens are two buckets, not one number with a
 * caveat.
 *
 * `promptTrace()` meters an identity's tokens whether or not its model
 * endpoint is attached — agents genuinely issue traced requests before the
 * substrate exists, and that is the cold-start beat the product tells. Those
 * tokens are real, and they rode the public internet. Tokens metered once the
 * endpoint is attached rode an AT&T path.
 *
 * Before this split the engine carried only `today`, so every surface that
 * wanted to say anything about exposure had to INFER it from a second, later
 * fact — the identity's route RIGHT NOW. That inference is wrong in both
 * directions and the product shipped both errors: `/ai/cost` printed "All 3
 * route to a model endpoint attached to the fabric, so none of that spend
 * leaves over the public internet" over a token total that was accrued public,
 * and `/ai/observe`'s briefing printed "No AI Fabric traffic currently crosses
 * the public internet" beside the same figure.
 *
 * The engine now carries both buckets, so no surface has to infer either.
 *
 * The engine is a shared singleton and mutations persist within this file, so
 * the unattached assertions come FIRST and the attaching describe runs last.
