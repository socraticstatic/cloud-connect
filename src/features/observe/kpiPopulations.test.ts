/**
 * A KPI tile is one number standing beside a table and a briefing rail that
 * describe the same estate. When the tile's population is not the table's, and
 * neither says so, the strip contradicts the page it heads.
 *
 * Both cases here were exactly that:
 *
 *  - `/naas/observe` read **P95 LATENCY 265ms** while the briefing rail on the
 *    same screen said "eu-north1 is the outlier at 204ms on the public path".
 *    The 265 came from a cloud-to-cloud row whose PUBLIC latency was priced off
 *    an AT&T backbone detour (`state-routing.ts`), so it was a figure no
 *    endpoint pair in the estate could produce.
 *  - `/ai/observe` read **TTFT 47ms** one click from `/ai/connect`'s catalog
 *    listing helion-cls-13b at **133ms P50** under a badge reading "3 / 3
 *    governed & ready", because TTFT counted only the models whose IDENTITY
 *    meter was ready (`tokenMeterList().ready` — attach AND the identity's
 *    governance fix) while the badge counts attach alone.
 *
 * Nothing below pins a millisecond: every expectation is read out of the engine
 * at assertion time.
