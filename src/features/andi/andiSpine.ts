/** Spine navigation, spoken in verdicts. Pure matcher: an utterance either
 *  is a spine phrase (answer = that screen's verdict + one navigate action)
 *  or it is not (null - the brain falls through to its other steps).
 *  Andi drafts; the human clicks.
 *
 *  ROUTES is checked in array order and the FIRST regex match wins - a
 *  query that names two spine topics ("show my connections and cost")
 *  resolves to whichever entry sits earlier in this list. Entries are
 *  ordered most-specific-first: discover ("what do i have") and connect
 *  ("fabric"/"attach") anchor on domain-specific jargon that is rarely
 *  said about anything else; observe's "traffic"/"observability" is
 *  similarly narrow; cost's words (saving/savings/spend/cost) are the
 *  most generic financial vocabulary in the table and so are ordered
 *  last, where they only win when nothing more specific also matched. */
