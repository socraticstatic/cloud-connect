 * under `--repeat-each`, the first tick lands mid-file and the estate is no
 * longer unlit. That is a test passing on a race.
 *
 * Suspending every agent is the engine's own supported freeze: `agentTick`
 * returns immediately when nothing is enabled. Done at module scope, so it
 * takes effect in the same tick the engine is imported, long before 7s.
