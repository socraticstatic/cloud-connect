/**
 * The single token-spend derivation for the AI Fabric.
 *
 * Two surfaces state token money: the Cost screen (`/ai/cost`) and the Cost /
 * Savings KPI tiles on the Observe screen (`/ai/observe`, via `aiBinding`).
 * They read this module rather than each re-deriving the same sum, so the two
 * screens cannot drift into stating different figures for the same estate.
 *
 * Everything here is a `CC` derivation taken at call time — `tokenMeterList()`
 * for volume, budget and endpoint readiness, `agentList()` for which model an
 * identity actually invokes, `modelCatalog()` for that model's name and price.
 * No literals, no clock, no random.
 *
 * ## Four different facts, never conflated
 *
 * The engine meters an identity's tokens from `promptTrace()` whether or not
 * its endpoint is ready — agents keep issuing requests either way — so
 * `tokenMeterList()` reports a `today` that can be non-zero while `ready` is
 * false. And `ready` is NOT the path. Four facts, not one:
 *
 * - `ungovernedToday` — of today's tokens, how many were metered while this
 *                     identity's route was public. The engine books this at
 *                     meter time (`state-billing.ts`), because it is the only
 *                     moment the fact is knowable: attaching an endpoint does
 *                     not retroactively govern spend that already left.
 *                     **This, and only this, is what token spend "crossed the
 *                     public internet" means.** A count of identities on a
 *                     public route right now is a different sentence, about a
 *                     different tense.
 * - `metering`      — this identity has accrued token spend today.
 * - `endpointReady` — `tokenMeterList().ready`, i.e. `endpointReadyFor()`: the
 *                     endpoint's prerequisites are met, meaning its region is
 *                     attached AND its governance control has been applied
 *                     (`fixes.segmentHelion` / `fixes.fwInspection`). This is
 *                     what gates the engine's SERIES metering — `tickTokens`
 *                     and `tokenSeries` — and nothing else.
 *                     **Readiness gates metering, not path.**
 * - `routePath`     — `modelRoutes().path`: where an identity's requests
 *                     actually go (`private` / `governed egress` / `public`).
 *                     This, and only this, decides whether spend leaves over
 *                     the public internet. It turns on region attachment
 *                     alone — the same predicate `modelCatalog().ready` uses
 *                     for `/ai/connect`'s "governed & ready", and the same one
 *                     `/ai/observe`'s Route column and briefing read.
 *
 * The distinction is not academic. After the tour's Connect and Govern beats
 * (`activateOnramp('nb2')` + `enforceAny('pol-insp')`) every model is attached
 * and routed private or governed, while `rd-helion`'s `ready` is still false
 * because `fixes.segmentHelion` has not been applied. Reading `ready` as "on a
 * governed path" is what printed "1 of 3 … leave over the public internet" on
 * `/ai/cost` beside `/ai/connect`'s "3 / 3 governed & ready", `/ai/observe`'s
 * "No AI Fabric traffic currently crosses the public internet" and Discover's
 * "0 exposed endpoints" — with the remediation link pointing at the screen
 * that denied it.
 *
 * So: every sentence about where the NEXT request goes reads `routePath` /
 * `onPublicPath`; every sentence about where today's tokens WENT reads
 * `ungovernedToday` / `governedToday`; every count about spend accrual reads
 * `metering`; `endpointReady` is carried for callers that genuinely mean the
 * engine's readiness gate, and is never a path.
