/* ------------------------- the groups thread -------------------------

   Three beats carry one arc: the premises are visible in Discover, naming a
   set of them makes an id, and that id is what a policy is written against.
   Both mutating beats are IDEMPOTENT, because the tour is the thing a person
   clicks over and over while rehearsing:

   - addGroup returns null for an id that already exists, so the second run
     would otherwise fail silently and leave the later beats narrating a
     group that was never made. ensureSitesGroup checks first and treats
     "already named" as success — the estate ends in the same state either
     way, which is what idempotent means.
   - addRule does NOT dedupe; it appends. A second run would leave two
     identical policies in the rules table with the demo still on screen.
     ensurePayoffRule looks the rule up by name and re-enforces the one that
     exists instead of authoring a twin. enforceRule is itself a no-op on an
     already-enforced rule, so the third and fourth runs are free too. */

   Declaring an intent and CONTROLLING by one are two different things, and

   mode (IntentThreads' DeclareMenu forces it — "enforcement stays a separate,
   visible decision on the row"), and watch mode gates nothing: it counts what
   enforcing WOULD have denied.

   Enforce mode is the control. `setIntentMode(id,'enforce')` calls the
   catalog entry's `enforceControl`, and today exactly one of the eighteen
   entries carries one: cap-token-spend, whose control is the token policy's
   own `enforced` flag. The gate in promptTrace (state-console.ts) then needs
   all three — policy enforced, meter at or over its ceiling, and an
   enforce-mode cap intent covering the tag — before a request is denied.

   Both steps are idempotent, for the same reason the groups beats are.
   declareIntent already returns null on a duplicate (key + scope), and
   setIntentMode returns false when the mode is already what you asked for, so
   the second and third rehearsals are free. */

/**
 * Guided tour of Cloud Connect. The six-beat MVP demo arc — Discover, then
 * NaaS's Connect → Govern → Observe → Cost, closing on the AI Fabric's own
 * Govern — is the spine, and step
 * order is still bound to `DEMO_BEATS` (demoScript.ts): the tour visits those
 * sections in that order and never doubles back to one it has left.
 *
 * THREE LEGS, matching the layer-first IA the nav shipped. Sections that are
 * not in DEMO_BEATS were added inside the leg their subject already belongs
 * to, never between legs:
 *
 * - The ESTATE leg (`/discover`, `/tasks`) is everything above the layers.
 *   Discover is the front door; Tasks is the one queue every layer's work
 *   drains into, which is why it closes this leg rather than opening a
 *   layer's.
 * - The NAAS leg opens on `/naas/home`, because that is what picking a layer
 *   in the bar actually does now — a layer opens onto its board, never onto
 *   a verb. Then the four verbs, in lifecycle order.
 * - The AI leg opens on `/ai/keys`, the gateway's identity surface, for the
 *   same reason the NaaS leg opens on Connect: you attach and identify
 *   before you govern. Then Insights, then the token-policy close.
 *
 * Three beats are threaded INSIDE that spine rather than appended after it,
 * because groups are not an epilogue. Naming a set of premises is something
 * you do while looking at them, so it belongs in Discover; reading the group
 * back and writing it into a policy belong in Govern, next to the rule beat
 * that already explains how a rule is shaped. Bolting all three onto the end
 * would have made the payoff arrive after Cost and the AI Fabric had already
 * closed the story.
 *
 * Beats that meet surfaces shipped since the demo arc was written, each
 * threaded where the arc already carries its subject rather than bolted onto
 * the end:
 *
 * - `assessment` sits right after the Discover opener, because "measure for
 *   14 days first" is the answer to the question the scan raises.
 * - `intents` follows the naming beat on Discover: you named what you have,
 *   now declare what must stay true of it. The standing-intents band is the
 *   surface.
 * - `andi` follows intents. The intents band's own empty state says "tell
 *   Andi the outcome you want", so the beat that introduces Andi is the one
 *   that follows it. The toggle lives in the top bar, which renders on every
 *   route, so the beat stays on /discover and changes no section.
 * - `twin` follows Andi, and closes /discover. Andi's beat ends on "drafts,
 *   never commits"; this is the surface that sentence describes — the tray
 *   where a staged move is priced, shared and committed. Every mutating beat
 *   later in the tour commits directly, so if this beat is not shown the
 *   viewer never learns that the product's normal path does not.
 * - `tasks` closes the estate leg. It is the only surface that spans both
 *   layers, so it cannot sit inside one of them; and it is the accumulation
 *   of exactly what the twin beat just explained (one queue, priced, drained
 *   through the twin), so it reads as that beat's consequence.
 * - `intent-control` follows Tasks and stays on it, because the Watch/Enforce
 *   switch exists ONLY in the band's `manage` render, which /tasks carries and
 *   Discover deliberately does not (IntentThreads: "the cross-section is where
 *   promises are SEEN, Work is where they are kept"). The `intents` beat on
 *   Discover therefore could not carry this — it is pointing at a render with
 *   no switch on it. Declaring and controlling are two beats because they are
 *   two decisions in the product.
 * - `layer-home` opens the NaaS leg, ahead of Connect, because it is what
 *   the bar does: pick a layer, land on its board. It is also the only beat
 *   that states the IA out loud — layers across, lifecycle down.
 * - `proposals` opens the Govern leg, ahead of the rules table, which is
 *   where the band physically sits. It must come BEFORE the `govern` beat
 *   for a second reason: that beat's action enforces pol-insp, which drains
 *   the finding behind one of the proposals the band is showing.
 * - `gateway` opens the AI leg. A token policy is written against an
 *   identity, so the identities come first — the same order the NaaS leg
 *   uses when Connect precedes Govern.
 * - `insights` sits directly before the token-policy close: evidence first,
 *   then governance, mirroring the NaaS half of the arc.
 *
 * Each step's `targetSelector` is a `data-tour` attribute added to the
 * relevant component, or an existing stable `data-testid` other specs
 * already hold in place, and each `route` is the HashRouter path for that
 * section. `ProductTour` is route-agnostic — the consuming `TourLauncher`
 * navigates on `onStepChange` before the spotlight looks for the target on
 * the new page.
 *
 * SKIP MECHANISM. A step may carry `when`; `activeCloudConnectTour()`
 * evaluates it once per launch and leaves the step out of that run when it
 * returns false. It exists for the anchors that can legitimately be absent —
 * the assessment banner, and the proposal band on an estate with nothing to
 * propose — because a beat whose target is missing renders a flat overlay
 * with nothing spotlighted, which reads as a broken tour. Steps without
 * `when` always run.
 *
 * A step's target is only spotlighted if it's already in the DOM. Govern's
 * tab is therefore carried in the route (`?tab=groups`) rather than left to
 * component state — a beat pointing at the Groups table on a page that opens
 * on Policies is a dead beat.
 *
 * Any figure a beat SPEAKS is a thunk, evaluated when the beat is shown, so
 * it reads the estate as the beats before it left it.

    /* Length is load-bearing here, and the ceiling is tighter than the
       arithmetic suggests. /ai/keys seats the table at y≈140 and the page has
       almost no scroll below it, so ProductTour cannot lift the target to make
       room: the tooltip has to fit in the ~340px between the table's bottom
       edge and the viewport floor. The e2e overlap guard treats "they both fit
       a 720px viewport" as a promise of ZERO overlap, so a tooltip that only
       fits in principle fails. Measured: 470px → 0.238, 418px → 0.143, this
       one → 0. Trim something before adding a sentence here.

       The lifecycle claim this beat used to open with ("the AI rail speaks the
       same lifecycle as NaaS") was the sentence cut, because the layer-home
       beat already states it for both layers — this beat keeps only what is
       true of THIS screen. */

      // sentences already here, not by appending to them. Roughly 0.45px of
      // tooltip per character — budget ~380 chars and re-run the spec.
      // "Enforce one and a classified request … is denied" was the old close,

      // the truth out: the SCOPE gate (no-external / self-hosted) denies
      // "independent of whether the policy is enforced", while the enforced
      // flag governs the BUDGET gate — which stays shut until an enforce-mode
      // cap intent covers the identity, hence the pill's Armed state. The

      // gate accurately instead of borrowing its effect for enforcement.
