/**
 * Govern's first move.
 *
 * Eight rules render with identical weight and nothing says where to start.
 * This module answers one question — "enforce which one first?" — and, just
 * as importantly, says why in a currency the viewer can check by counting
 * the violation list underneath.
 *
 * ── The impact rule ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * Primary: VIOLATIONS CLEARED.
 *   Govern's unit of work is the open violation. It is the thing the screen
 *   already counts, in the header and in the list below the table, so a
 *   recommendation denominated in violations is one a viewer can verify
 *   without trusting us. Posture is a seven-category roll-up whose `policy`
 *   term is itself a function of violation count, so ranking on posture
 *   would lead with a derived number that mostly restates the plain one.
 *   Dollars are excluded outright: savings belong to Cost, and a governance
 *   screen that recommends by money is recommending the wrong thing.
 *
 * Tie 1: PROJECTED BEATS UNPROJECTED.
 *   The promise of this card is "here is what will happen before you commit".
 *   A rule whose after-state the engine can compute keeps that promise more
 *   fully than one whose it cannot, so at equal violations cleared the
 *   projectable rule leads.
 *
 * Tie 2: POSTURE POINTS, then RULE PRIORITY.
 *   Two rules can each clear one violation and still differ in exposure
 *   effect. Where both are projectable, posture separates them; where it
 *   cannot, the author's own stated priority order does.
 *
 * ── Rules with no bound remediation ────────────────────────────────────────
 * Three seeded rules (pol-pci, pol-internet-facing, pol-branch-finance) carry
 * no `fix` key, so `previewFix` has nothing to preview and returns nothing to
 * compare. They are NOT dropped and they are NOT floored to zero impact —
 * either would sort them last as if they were harmless, which they are not.
 * Instead their cleared-count is read from the same live source the violation
 * list renders from: the open violations stamped with their own policy id.
 * That number is exactly what enforcing them clears (`evalExample` returns no
 * violations once enforced), so it is a real projection, arrived at by a
 * different route. What we decline to invent is their posture delta — that
 * stays null and the card says the effect is not projected rather than
 * printing a number the engine never produced.
 *
 * On the seeded estate this lands them 4th, 5th and 6th of eight, ahead of
 * pol-dns and pol-perimeter — both fully previewable, both clearing nothing.
