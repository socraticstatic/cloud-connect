/**
 * What just happened, stated where it happened.
 *
 * IDIOM. This is the second half of RuleBuilder's dry run and it is built to
 * be read as such: the same `rounded-xl border border-fw-secondary` result
 * surface, the same small-caps header line, the same "one claim in the header,
 * the evidence itemised beneath". The dry run says "Dry run · nothing has
 * changed yet". This says "Enforced · this is what changed". A toast would
 * have said neither — it would have said "Rule enforced" and vanished.
 *
 * PLACEMENT. Directly above NextMoveBand, inside the rules card: consequence
 * first, then the re-pointed recommendation. That is the order the two things
 * happen in, and it puts the answer immediately under the header whose
 * "N / M enforced" counter just moved. It does not duplicate the violation
 * list below the table — that list enumerates what is still open; this states
 * what changed.
 *
 * MOTION. A single 300ms fade-and-rise on the shared `cc-reveal` keyframe
 * (index.css), applied through the `motion-safe:` variant — i.e. inside
 * `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference)`, so under `reduce` the
 * animation is never applied at all.
 *
 * It has to be `motion-safe:`, not a bare utility leaning on the global
 * `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` block in index.css. That block zeroes
 * `animation-duration` on the universal selector, but this project sets
 * `important: true` in tailwind.config.js, so a bare `[animation:...]`
 * utility emits `!important` on the animation SHORTHAND from a class
 * selector — which outranks an `!important` longhand on `*` and would have
 * silently kept animating for exactly the users who asked it not to.
 *
 * Either way the panel is fully rendered and fully readable; motion only
 * affects its arrival.
 *
 * COLOUR. Green for movement in the wanted direction, slate for everything
 * else. No amber anywhere. No red: red on this screen is reserved for true
 * policy violations (the list below), and neither an improvement nor an
 * unmoved figure is one.
