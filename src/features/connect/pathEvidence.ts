 * five transport mechanisms (IP / IPSec / PrivateLink / cloud-native /
 * dedicated) a path can ride. A customer picks a path here; the mechanism
 * follows from it.
 *
 * Every field on PathEvidence is read from the engine — `cc.fabricModel()`
 * for the shaped region (latency, which on-ramps reach it) and the on-ramp
 * seeds for the facility evidence (`site`, `sub`, `planned`). Nothing here is
 * asserted by copy alone, and nothing is asserted that the engine does not
 * carry: the whole point of the surface is that the decision is driven by
 * portal data. What is constant per path rather than derived per region —
 * the isolation posture — lives on `ConnectivityPath`, not on `PathEvidence`,
 * so the evidence list contains only figures that move with the estate.
 *
 * Named `pathEvidence.ts` (not `pathChoice.ts`) for the same reason
 * `attachCatalog.ts` is: data files are named after their content, and a
 * `pathChoice.ts` next to `PathChoice.tsx` collides on a case-insensitive
 * filesystem — `import from './PathChoice'` silently resolves to the `.ts`.
